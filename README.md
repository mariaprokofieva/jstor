tutorial on using JSTOR database in R

JSTOR is one of the main academic databases with a good range of resources on business, information systems and data science.
To be exact - more than 1,900 journal titles in more than 50 disciplines. It also has books!

The beauty is that it provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals.

Now, it does come with API access which requires a login setup https://labs.jstor.org/api/docs/, but it also has a function to generate a file with links for download
